        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
        looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
        amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
        found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
        weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
        completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
        a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
        needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
        The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
        hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
        next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
        often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
        developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
